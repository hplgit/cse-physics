# File organization

All relevant *published* files are in the `doc/pub` directory. To view
HTML and PDF files on the web, the files must be in the gh-pages
branch. All source code is in the master branch in the `doc/src`
directory. The file `doc/src/make.sh` translates the DocOnce source
`doc/src/uniped15.do.txt` to LaTeX/PDF and HTML format and publishes
the result in `doc/pub`.  The master and gh-pages branches are fully
synchronized in this repo.
